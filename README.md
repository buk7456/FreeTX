## Compiling the firmware
The code compiles on arduino ide 1.8.x or later. The code is self-contained so doesn't require installing any libraries. 

## Hardware and Schematics
The transmiter and receiver schematics can be found in the 'schematics' folder. 
The major components are listed below.
- 1x Atmega2560 microcontroller, 2x Atmega328p microcontrollers.
- 2x SX1276/77/78/79 or RFM95 based Lora modules. However any module can possibly be used.
- 128x64 KS0108 based LCD. Any 128x64 LCD can however be used (provide own driver code).

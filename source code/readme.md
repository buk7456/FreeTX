This folder contains the source code of the firmware for the main (mtx) and secondary (stx) transmitter microcontrollers, as well as the receiver microcontroller.  
The code compiles on arduino ide 1.8.x or later. The code is self-contained so doesn't require installing any libraries.  
I highly recommend browsing or editing the code with an editor such as Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.  
If you are using the legacy Arduino 1.8.x IDE, you need to enable the "Use external editor" option.  
For VScode, simply open the folder (e.g. mtx) as project. For notepad++, use the "Open folder as workspace".

The screens in the UI have been designed with [GraphicsGale](https://graphicsgale.com/us/) from scratch using primitives (pixels, lines, rectangles, text).  
In case you want to modify or add new screens, here are the 'getting started' instructions.
- Install the GraphicsGale software
- Install the font Bm437_Portfolio_6x8_modBUK.FON provided in this folder to your system.

In GraphicsGale under new file, 
- Set the canvas to 128x64 (or your screen size)
- When drawing text, set the font to "Bm437 Portfolio 6x8", size 8, pitch 0

For converting icons or sprites bitmaps to byte arrays, I used the tool [image2cpp](http://javl.github.io/image2cpp/)

Making a custom splash screen
----------------------------------

Prerequisites
- Python installed on your computer
- Pillow library (install via command pip install Pillow if not already installed)

Steps
1. Make or prepare the image using any image editing software, with dimensions 128px width and 64px height.
2. Export it as "image.bmp" file.
3. Put the file into the same folder as the python script, then run the python script.
4. Create a folder "IMAGES" on the SD card, then copy the generated "splash" to it.

Now whenever you power on your rc transmitter, it shows your custom splash screen.

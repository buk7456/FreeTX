
==============================================================================================
1. Format of packet
==============================================================================================
Packets are of fixed length, whether from transmitter or receiver. 
The general format of a packet is as shown below.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Source ID   Dest ID   Packet ID   Payload                  Packet CRC
  1 byte      1 byte    1 byte      (((n*10)+7)/8)+1 bytes   1 byte
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
where n is the number of rc channels. 
e.g. for 20 channels, the payload size would be 26 bytes, making total packet length 30 bytes.

1.1 Source ID and Destination ID 
================================
- If packet is originating from transmitter, then Source ID is the Transmitter ID. 
  Similarly if packet is originating from the receiver, then Source ID is the Receiver ID. 
- Allowed transmitter IDs range from 0x01 to 0xFF.  Transmitter ID 0x00 is reserved. 
- Allowed receiver IDs range from 0x01 to 0xFF, Receiver ID 0X00 used when binding.

1.2 Packet Identifier
================================
This uniquely identifies which kind of data we are sending. Below are some identifiers.
- Bind
- Acknowledge bind
- RC data
- Telemetry
- Read receiver configuration
- Set receiver configuration
- Acknowledge receiver configuration

1.3 Payload
================================
1.3.1 Bind data
----------------
  byte 0 to k  Hop channels, 1 byte per channel.
  byte k+1     Flags, bit0 whether we are addressing the main or secondary receiver.
  byte k+2     Receiver Id to use if binding as a secondary receiver.
To acknowledge bind, the receiver simply returns its ID as the payload with packet identifier 
as 'Acknowledge bind'.

1.3.2 RC data
--------------
All rc channels are transmitted in a single packet.  
Each channel is encoded with 10 bits, flags are transmitted in the next byte. 
The flag byte is as follows: 
  bits 0 to 2  RF power level.
  bit 3        return telemetry.
  bit 4        whether this is failsafe data.
  
1.3.3 Telemetry data from receiver
-----------------------------------
  byte 0       packet rate at receiver side.
  byte 1 to k  custom telemetry fields.
Each telemetry field is formatted as follows:-
  byte 0       sensor ID, 0xFF if telemetry field is empty.
  byte 1       high byte of telemetry value.
  byte 2       low byte of telemetry value.
  
1.3.4 Receiver output configuration settings
---------------------------------------------
Reading from the receiver:
Reading the configuration is initiated by the transmitter. The payload is as follows:-
  byte 0       Flags, bit0 whether we are addressing the main or secondary receiver.
The relevant receiver (main or secondary) then responds with the present configuration along 
with the maximum supported configuration.
Each channel's configuration is sent on a separate byte, where the lower nibble holds the 
present configuration, and the upper nibble holds the maximum configuration.

Writing to the receiver:
The transmitter sends the configuration to the receiver as follows:-
  byte 0 to k  the desired configuration, 1 byte per channel.
  byte k+1     Flags, bit0 whether we are addressing the main or secondary receiver.
To acknowledge the configuration sent by the transmitter, the relevant receiver returns an 
empty payload with packet identifier as 'Acknowledge receiver configuration'.

==============================================================================================
2. Dual receiver setup
==============================================================================================
Basic rules:
- Depending on the setup, the main receiver may handle one half of the rc channels,
  while the secondary handles the other half. However the entire rc channels are always sent 
  in a single transmission.
- When binding to the main receiver, the transmitter generates a random transmitter ID 
  and hop sequence. The main receiver then generates a random receiver ID and sends it.
- When binding to a secondary receiver, the transmitter ID and receiver ID are maintained, as 
  well as the Hop sequence. 
- Only the main receiver can send telemetry, the secondary ignores the telemetry requests.
- The transmitter requests and sends configuration settings to each receiver separately 
  by way of a flag to distinguish the intended receiver from the other.

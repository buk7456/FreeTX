  PROTOCOL OVER RF
====================================================================================================

General format of a packet is as below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Field    |  Header    Payload         CRC             
Size     |  3 bytes   0 to 26 bytes   1 byte          
Offset   |  0         3               3 + payloadLength  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Header
==============
Encoded from left to right as follows:
  Source ID         7 bits
  Destination ID    7 bits
  Packet type       5 bits
  Payload length    5 bits

If packet is originating from transmitter, then Source ID is the Transmitter ID. 
Similarly if a packet is originating from the receiver, then Source ID is the Receiver ID. 
The allowed transmitter IDs range from 0x01 to 0x7F.  Transmitter ID 0x00 is reserved. 
The allowed receiver IDs range from 0x01 to 0xFF. Receiver ID 0x00 used when binding.


Packet types
==============
The following enumerations are used to identify the packet:-

enum {
  PACKET_BIND = 0,
  PACKET_ACK_BIND = 1,
  PACKET_READ_OUTPUT_CH_CONFIG = 2,
  PACKET_SET_OUTPUT_CH_CONFIG = 3,
  PACKET_ACK_OUTPUT_CH_CONFIG = 4,
  PACKET_RC_DATA = 5,
  PACKET_TELEMETRY_GENERAL = 6,
  PACKET_TELEMETRY_GNSS = 7,

  PACKET_INVALID = 0xFF
};


Payload
===============

PACKET_BIND:

  The payload is as follows:
    byte 0 to k  Hop channels, 1 byte per channel.
    byte k+1     Flags, bit0 whether we are addressing the main or secondary receiver.
    byte k+2     Receiver ID to use if binding as a secondary receiver.
  
  To acknowledge bind, the receiver simply returns its ID as the payload with packet identifier 
  as "PACKET_ACK_BIND".
  

PACKET_ACK_BIND:
  
  This is returned by the receiver to acknowledge the binding. 
  The payload is as follows:
    byte 0      Receiver ID

  
PACKET_RC_DATA:

  All RC channel data are sent in a single transmission.
  The data is either RC channel outputs values or faisafe data, encoded with 10 bits per channel.   
  Flags are transmitted in a separate byte that is appended. 
  The flag byte is as follows: 
    bits 0 to 2   RF power level.
    bit 3         Return telemetry.
    bit 4         Whether this is failsafe data.


PACKET_TELEMETRY_GENERAL:

  This originates from the receiver. 
  The payload is as follows:
    byte 0       packet rate at receiver side.
    byte 1 to k  general telemetry fields.
  
  Every 3 bytes represent a telemetry field.
  Each telemetry field is formatted as: 
    byte 0    SensorID
    byte 1    high byte of telemetry value
    byte 2    low byte of telemetry value


PACKET_TELEMETRY_GNSS:

  This originates from the receiver.
  The payload is a structure containing the GNSS telemetry information.
  See the "telemetry.md" file for more details.


PACKET_READ_OUTPUT_CH_CONFIG:

  This can originate from both the transmitter and receiver.
  
  Case of origin from transmitter:-
    Payload is 1 byte.
    Value is as follows.
      0   Secondary receiver is being addressed.
      1   Main receiver is being addressed.
  
  Case of origin from receiver:-
    Each RC channel's output configuration is sent on a separate byte, encoded as follows.
    bits 0 to 1   The present mode. Value is as follows: 
                    0  Digital, 
                    1  Servo PWM, 
                    2  Normal PWM.
    bits 2 to 3   The maximum supported mode.
    bits 4 to 7   The servo pwm range. Value is and index in the lookup table.
                  See the "servo_PWM_range_LUT.xls" for extended description.


PACKET_SET_OUTPUT_CH_CONFIG:

  This originates from the transmitter. 
  The format is the same as PACKET_READ_OUTPUT_CH_CONFIG from the receiver, except that the 
  field "maximum supported mode" is not applicable.
  An extra byte is appended, containing a flag that specifies which receiver is being addressed.
   

PACKET_ACK_OUTPUT_CH_CONFIG:

  This originates from the receiver. 
  The payload is empty. This packet merely tells the transmitter that the settings have been 
  properly received and applied.
  
  
CRC
=============
The 8 bit CRC of all the preceding bytes, including the header.


====================================================================================================
  Dual receiver setup
====================================================================================================
Basic rules:
- Depending on the setup, the main receiver may handle one half of the RC channels,
  while the secondary handles the other half. However the entire RC data is always sent 
  in a single transmission.
- When binding to the main receiver, the transmitter generates a random transmitter ID 
  and hop sequence. The main receiver then generates a random receiver ID and sends it.
- When binding to a secondary receiver, the transmitter ID and receiver ID are maintained, as 
  well as the hop sequence. 
- Only the main receiver can send telemetry, the secondary ignores the telemetry requests.
- The transmitter requests and sends configuration settings to each receiver separately 
  by way of a flag to distinguish the intended receiver from the other.

1. Curve features f>0 f<0 |f| are dropped. These can be achieved with logical switches as they 
   simply output -max or max. No need to duplicate features.

2. Telemetry readings for minimum and maximum values can be sensitive to outliers. Filtering is 
   not done at the transmitter side; rather, it is left to the sensor to handle filtering 
   and smoothing of readings to ensure they are not jittery prior to transmission.

  Issues

OPEN ISSUES
-----------
- If a mixer control switch (that turns the mix on or off) is flipped rapidly before the delay has finished, 
  the delay feature doesn't work as expected, the source leaks through. This issue has existed since alpha versions.
  Seems this is the correct behaviour because delay is only meant to delay the input, not to delay turning on or off the mix.

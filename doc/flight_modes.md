# Flight modes

Flight modes allow you to easily reconfigure settings such as mixes and trim values with the simple flip of a switch. While it's possible to achieve similar adjustments using multiple switches, having the ability to make all these changes with just one switch is undoubtedly more efficient and convenient.
